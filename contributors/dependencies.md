You will also need to use branch `fix-clarc-tests` of Math, Craco, and the [old Protocols project](https://github.com/cryptimeleon/upb.crypto.protocols/tree/fix-clarc-tests).

For more information installation, see the [CLARC Readme](https://github.com/cryptimeleon/upb.crypto.clarc/blob/fix-clarc-tests/README.md).

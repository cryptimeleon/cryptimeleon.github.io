title: How Do I Contribute?
---

To contribute code to a repository, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks) that repository.
Then add your changes and [create a pull request from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

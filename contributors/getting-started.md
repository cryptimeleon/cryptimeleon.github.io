We are glad you are interested in contributing to Cryptimeleon.
This page will give you an overview of our contribution/developer guidelines and will point you to further information.

## Overview

The Cryptimeleon libraries consist of a number of related cryptographic libraries united under the Cryptimeleon name.
If you want to contribute, you therefore first need to decide on a specific library.
Then you can check out that library's issue tracker (we use the Github issue tracker) to find something to work on.

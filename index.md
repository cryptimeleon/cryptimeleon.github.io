Welcome to the documentation page for the upb.crypto libraries developed by the [Codes and Cryptography group](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/cuk-1) at Paderborn University, Germany. This page is currently under construction.

upb.crypto is a collection of Java libraries for prototyping and research purposes in the area of cryptography.
None of the libraries are vetted for use in security-critical production environments and we strongly discourage such use.

## How do I report issues/suggest improvements?

Please use the issue tracker from the corresponding github repository over on [our github](https://github.com/upbcuk).
If you are not sure which repository exactly the issue belongs to, just pick one and we can move it if necessary.

## What software is required to use the libraries?

In general you only need Java SDK Version 8 or higher.
To use the upb.crypto.mclwrap wrapper, you additionally need to install the Mcl Java bindings (more info on this [here]({% link getting-started/installation.md %})).

## Which operating systems do you support?

Since Java is cross-platform, the libraries should run on Linux/Mac Os and Windows.
Keep in mind that we develop on Linux/Mac Os and do not necessarily test on Windows.
